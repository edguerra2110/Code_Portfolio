    "An interface to a system is a control, or a set of controls, that affords access to that system’s state and/or operation. A common example of an interface is an automobile’s dashboard. A dashboard contains controls that enable a driver to start, drive, monitor, and stop a car without understanding how a car’s components operate.\n",
    "\n",
    "An Application Programmable Interface (API) is an interface through which components can access a software component’s state and/or functionality. APIs take different forms, depending on the requirements that they need to address. For example, an API can be designed to support stateful or stateless interactions between two interacting components: the former assumes that the components “remember” information about the sequence of interactions, while the latter requires each interaction to be self-contained. In a network environment, an API can be designed to “hide” the network—i.e., to blur the distinction between requests and procedure calls—or expose it. And the elements of an API’s interface can be given standard or custom names—again, depending on a system’s requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "A set of well-known guidelines for designing an APIs is known as an API architecture.  Some common API architectures include RPC, SOAP, and REST. This module focuses on REST: a simple to use and common API architecture that was developed  in the context of the HTTP and HTTPS protocols.\n",

    "The REST architecture was first described in Roy Fielding’s 2000 Ph.D. dissertation. Fielding argued that earlier API architectures for network communication, which used remote procedure call (RPC) to blur the distinction between accesses to local and networked components, were deeply flawed: i.e., that protocols for network communication had to expose challenges that were particular to networked environments to be effective. These challenges include latency, limitations on communications bandwidth, and interruptions of service such as server crashes. Fielding’s REST architecture, which stands for Representational State Transfer, emphasized the need for statelessness in network communications as a means of simplifying crash recovery. REST also defined HTTP, including the semantics of GET, PUT, and POST and the error codes for responding to problem requests.\n",

    "A RESTful API is one that meets Fielding’s five constraints for API interaction:\n",
    "-The API supports client-server-style, request-response-based communications via HTTP.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Communications are stateless: i.e., every request is self-contained, in that it supplies all data needed to meet the request, including (e.g.) proof of the requestor’s authority to make the request. Statelessness simplifies maintenance by eliminating the need for servers to restart dialogues following crashes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Responses must be cacheable. This allows for the server to reduce the number of calls made which improves the overall network efficiency and scalability; however, the developer must be wary of stale data.\n",
